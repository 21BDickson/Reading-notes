# Reading Day 9
There really isnt a standard for what text editor to use. A text editor can help you edit and manage texts when youre making a website. When typing and writing code you can use something called Syntax Highlight to change the color of the code to make it easier to organize and read. Some computers come with software already installed on the computer that can make it easier to worite the code. Different text editors have different tools and applications within them that can be used in different scenarios so make sure you choose the right one for the job you're trying to do. Along with text editors you can also get IDE's which are essentially a suite where all code comes together. Make sure you look at different applications and find which one will be a best fit for you.
